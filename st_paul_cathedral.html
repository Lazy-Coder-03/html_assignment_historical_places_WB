      <h1>St. Paul's Cathedral</h1>
      <p>St. Paul's Cathedral is a Church of North India (CNI) cathedral in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is noted for its Gothic architecture and is dedicated to Paul the Apostle. The cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta and is located on Cathedral Road in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>The cornerstone of the cathedral was laid in 1839, and the building was completed in 1847. It is considered the largest church in Kolkata and the first Anglican cathedral in Asia. The cathedral was also the first new-built cathedral in the overseas territory of the British Empire.</p>
      <p>The architectural design of the cathedral is "Indo-Gothic," which is a Gothic architectural style adapted to the climate of India. The cathedral was reconstructed after the 1897 earthquake and the massive earthquake of 1934, which caused substantial damage to Calcutta.</p>

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>The cathedral is situated at 51, Chowringhee Road, across from the Bishop's House and in line with the Victoria Memorial. It is located to the east of the Victoria Memorial and at the southern edge of the maidan, the largest open space in the city.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The cathedral was built to replace St. John's Church, which had become too small for Calcutta's growing European community. Construction of the cathedral began in 1839, under the leadership of Bishop Daniel Wilson, and it was completed in 1847.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the cathedral has undergone refurbishment and reconstruction, especially after the earthquakes in 1897 and 1934. The current design incorporates Gothic Revival elements and modern construction techniques.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>St. Paul's Cathedral features Indo-Gothic architecture. The cathedral's design includes three stained-glass windows and two frescoes in the Florentine Renaissance style. The nave is spacious, and the central spire rises to a height of 201 feet. The cathedral also houses a library and displays various plastic art forms and memorabilia.</p>

      <h2>Burials</h2>
      <p>The cathedral is the burial site of notable individuals, including Bishop Daniel Wilson and John Paxton Norman, an acting Chief Justice who was assassinated on the steps of Kolkata Town Hall in 1871.</p>
