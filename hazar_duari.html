      <h1>Hazarduari Palace</h1>
      <p>Hazarduari Palace, earlier known as the Bara Kothi, is located in the campus of Kila Nizamat in Murshidabad, West Bengal. It was built in the nineteenth century under the reign of Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The palace is named "Hazarduari" as it has a thousand doors, with 100 of them being false doors to confuse potential thieves.</p>

      <h2>Kila Nizamat</h2>
      <p>Kila Nizamat, also known as Nizamat Kila or Nizamat Fort, was the site of the old fort of Murshidabad. It was located on the present site of Hazarduari Palace, on the banks of the Bhagirathi river.</p>

      <h2>Museum</h2>
      <p>The Hazarduari Palace has been transformed into a museum, housing collections from the Nawabs, including priceless paintings, furniture, antiques, and more. The museum also features a famous mirror and a chandelier, which is the second largest in the world after the one in Buckingham Palace. In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation.</p>

      <h3>Miniature</h3>
      <p>A miniature of the palace, made by Sagore Mistri in ivory, along with portraits of the Nawab and his son, were sent to King William IV. The Nawab was honored with a full-size portrait of the King and an autographed letter, as well as the badge and insignia of the Royal Guelphic and Hanoverian order, which are still preserved in the palace.</p>
