      <h1>Jorasanko Thakur Bari</h1>
      <p>Jorasanko Thakur Bari, located in Jorasanko, North Kolkata, West Bengal, India, is the ancestral home of the Tagore family. It is the birthplace of poet Rabindranath Tagore and the host of the Rabindra Bharati University campus.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Jorasanko Thakur Bari was built in the 18th century in Jorasanko in the north of Kolkata. The land on which this ancestral home stands today was donated by the Sett family to Prince Dwarkanath Tagore, who was the grandfather of Rabindranath Tagore. Prince Dwarkanath Tagore was the adopted son of Ramlochon Tagore and joined the Brahmo Samaj, which forced him to leave his ancestral house at Pathutiaghata. The Sett family donated the land to Prince Dwarkanath Tagore, and from the small dual bridges ("Sanko" meaning bridges in Bengali) on the land came the name Jorasanko.</p>
      <p>Nilmoni Tagore left his paternal house due to family disputes and set up his new residence at Jorasanko. The residential complex was expanded by Prince Dwarakanath Tagore, and it was here that Rabindranath Tagore was born in 1861. Another house adjacent to this, called the Boithak Khana Bari, became the residence of Girindranath and the art-workspace of Abanindranath and Gaganendranath Tagore. Unfortunately, this house was destroyed and pulled down in 1943. The Bhdrashan Bari, presently located at 6, Dwarakanath Tagore Lane, is known as the Maharshi Bhavan.</p>

      <h2>Rabindra Bharati University</h2>
      <p>The Rabindra Bharati University was established by the government of West Bengal in 1961 to commemorate the birth centenary of Rabindranath Tagore. The university is located at the Tagore family's Jorasanko residence and aims at the advancement of culture and arts.</p>

      <h2>Rabindra Bharati Museum</h2>
      <p>The house has been restored to reflect the way the household looked when the Tagore family lived in it and currently serves as the Tagore museum. It offers details about the history of the Tagore family, including their involvement in the Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj. Photography is strictly prohibited inside the museum, but allowed outside. There is also a light and sound show in the evening.</p>

      <h3>Inaugural Plaque - Rabindra Bharati Museum - Maharshi Bhavan - Jorasanko Thakur Bari</h3>
      <p>The Government of West Bengal established the Rabindra Bharati University in honor of Rabindranath Tagore. The university was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. The university aims at the advancement of culture and arts.</p>

      <h3>Rabindra Bharati Museum Collection</h3>
      <p>The museum has a wide-ranging collection. Galleries are devoted to the leading figures of the Bengali Renaissance, including Dwarakanath, Debendranath, Rabindranath, Aban Thakur, and Gaganendranath. There is also a gallery displaying artworks from the Bengal School of Art founded by Abanindranath Tagore. Another gallery showcases portraits and paintings of the Tagore house and family by the Anglo-Indian school, known as the Western Art Gallery. Galleries devoted to Rabindranath display his life, works, and ideas, as well as his visits, tours, influence, and relationships with other countries like Japan, China, Hungary, and the United States. There are also plans to create an Italy Gallery to strengthen Italy-India bilateral and cultural relations.</p>

      <h2>Visits and Programmes</h2>
      <p>The Rabindra Bharati University organizes regular cultural programs on Tagore's birthday, Panchise Baisakh, when thousands flock to Jorasanko Thakur Bari. They also organize events on other occasions, such as his death anniversary, Baishe Shravan, and a festival of arts called Aban Mela.</p>
